            (Shy one)walking by the wall
            (Shy one) the shadows will not fall
            (Shy one) is silently ignored
            (Quiet one) discouraged by the noise
            (Quiet one) living without choice
            (Quiet one) is a life without a voice

            When you can't even say my name
            Has the memory gone? Are you feeling numb?
            Go and call my name
            I can't play this game, so I ask again
            Will you say my name?
            Has the memory gone? Are you feeling numb?
            Or have I become invisible?

            that dreamers wish away
            (Hindsight) is falling on my face
            (Highlights) the shape of my disgrace

            When you don't hear a word I say
            As the talking goes, it's a one-way flow
            No fault, no blame
            Has the memory gone? Are you feeling numb?
            And have I become invisible?

            And no one hears a word they say
            Has the memory gone? Are you feeling numb?
            Not a word they say
            But a voiceless crowd isn't backing down
            When the air turns red
            With their loaded hesitation
            Can you say my name?
            Has the memory gone? Are you feeling numb?
            Have we all become invisible?
